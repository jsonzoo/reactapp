# reactapp

This project was created as a way for me to learn and practice using the React framework. It serves as the website for my club, providing information about our events, activities, and how to get involved.

Through building this app, I explored React concepts such as components, props, state management, and styling. The project also helped me understand how to structure a real-world web application and collaborate using Git and GitHub.
